1. Overview and Purpose

Project Title:
Audio Conversational AI Interface

Project Summary:
This project aims to build a full-stack application that lets users interact with a conversational system using their voice. The frontend (built in Next.js) captures user audio via the browser’s MediaRecorder API. The backend (implemented in NestJS) processes the uploaded audio by converting it to text using a Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text), applies custom text processing or AI logic to generate a response, and then converts the response into audio using a Text-to-Speech API (e.g., Google Cloud Text-to-Speech). The processed audio response is then returned to the user.

Purpose:

    Provide a seamless audio-based interactive experience.

    Demonstrate integration of modern frontend frameworks (Next.js) with robust backend services (NestJS).

    Leverage cloud-based AI services to perform speech recognition and synthesis.

    Serve as a foundation for further enhancement (multi-language support, advanced NLP processing, etc.).

2. Goals and Objectives

Primary Goals:

    Enable users to record audio and receive an audio response.

    Ensure accurate transcription of the input audio.

    Provide meaningful processing of transcribed text (using simple echo logic or integrated AI).

    Synthesize a natural-sounding audio response.

Objectives:

    User Experience: Create a user-friendly interface for recording, uploading, and playing back audio.

    Performance: Maintain low latency from audio recording to playback of the response.

    Scalability: Design the system to handle multiple simultaneous requests with proper error handling.

    Integration: Seamlessly integrate with third-party APIs (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech).

3. Scope

In Scope:

    Frontend:

        A Next.js application that accesses the microphone using the MediaRecorder API.

        A user interface (UI) with controls to start/stop recording and display status messages.

        Handling and sending the recorded audio to the backend.

    Backend:

        A NestJS service that exposes an endpoint (e.g., /process) to receive audio files.

        Audio processing pipeline:

            Convert audio file to base64.

            Call the Speech-to-Text API for transcription.

            Process the text (using a placeholder function or integrated NLP service).

            Call the Text-to-Speech API to synthesize an audio response.

        Return the audio response to the frontend.

Out of Scope:

    Advanced NLP processing or integration with multiple AI services (beyond basic text processing).

    User authentication or personalization beyond the core audio processing workflow.

    Persistent storage of recordings or user sessions.

4. User Personas and Use Cases

User Persona 1:
Name: Alex
Role: End-user interested in interacting with digital assistants via voice.
Use Case: Alex visits the application, records a short voice query, and receives an audio response that clarifies or echoes the query.

User Persona 2:
Name: Jamie
Role: Developer evaluating the ease of integration between modern frontend and backend frameworks.
Use Case: Jamie uses the application to test the integration of Next.js and NestJS with cloud AI services and evaluates the system’s latency and reliability.

Use Cases:

    Record and Send Audio:
    The user accesses the application, clicks a “Record” button to capture audio, then stops recording. The audio file is sent to the backend for processing.

    Process Audio and Return Response:
    The backend receives the audio, transcribes it, processes the text, synthesizes an audio response, and sends it back to the user. The frontend then plays the audio response.

    Error Handling:
    The system notifies the user if there is an error (e.g., microphone access issues, API failures) and provides a fallback message.

5. Functional Requirements
Frontend (Next.js)

    Audio Capture:

        Use the MediaRecorder API to capture audio.

        Provide UI buttons to start and stop recording.

    File Handling:

        Create an audio Blob from the recording.

        Wrap the audio Blob in a FormData object for transmission.

    API Communication:

        Send a POST request with the audio file to the backend endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3001/process).

        Receive and play back the audio response.

    Status Updates:

        Display real-time status messages (e.g., “Recording…”, “Processing audio…”, “Playing response audio.”).

Backend (NestJS)

    File Upload Endpoint:

        Expose a /process endpoint that accepts multipart/form-data.

        Use file interceptors (e.g., Multer with memory storage) to handle audio uploads.

    Audio Processing Pipeline:

        Convert the received audio file (buffer) into a format (base64) compatible with cloud APIs.

        Speech-to-Text: Call Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API with proper configuration (encoding, sample rate, language).

        Text Processing: Process the transcribed text using either a simple echo function or an integrated NLP module.

        Text-to-Speech: Call Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API to synthesize an audio response.

    Response Handling:

        Return the synthesized audio (MP3) to the frontend with correct headers for playback.

    Error Handling:

        Log errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes with user-friendly error messages.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        Total processing time (record → transcribe → process → synthesize) should ideally be within 5–10 seconds.

    Reliability:

        Implement retries and error handling for third-party API calls.

    Scalability:

        Design the backend to handle multiple concurrent requests with stateless processing.

    Security:

        Validate file uploads to prevent injection attacks.

        Secure API keys and credentials (using environment variables and secure storage).

    Usability:

        The frontend should work across modern browsers that support the MediaRecorder API.

        Provide clear instructions and status updates to guide the user.

    Maintainability:

        Use modular code structure in both Next.js and NestJS.

        Write unit tests for key functionalities (e.g., audio processing pipeline).

7. Technical Architecture
